This is a machine learning library developed by Sergio Remigio
for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

github url: https://github.com/SergioRemigio/DecisionTree


I created multiple python files with their own individual run.sh for
every question (2a-2e) and (4a-4b). 

If you are looking for the python files for question 2a-2e then simply go into
the Ensemble Learning folder and open the desired Question folder. Inside of each question
folder there is a run.sh file that will run the program to produce
the results for the homework question.

For questions 4a-4b then go to the Linear Regression folder and open
the desired Question folder. Everything is the same as before.
