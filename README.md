This is a machine learning library developed by Sergio Remigio
for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

github url: https://github.com/SergioRemigio/DecisionTree

The python code, homework1 pdf, and another readme are in the car folder.

I only had enough time to implement a DecisionTree for the car
data so there isn't anything important in the bank folder.
