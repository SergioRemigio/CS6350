This is a machine learning library developed by Sergio Remigio
for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah
github url: https://github.com/SergioRemigio/DecisionTree


I created multiple python files with their own individual run.sh for
every question (2a-2b)

If you are looking for the python files for question 2a-2b then simply go into
 Question folder. Inside of each question
folder there is a run.sh file that will run the program to produce
the results for the homework question.
