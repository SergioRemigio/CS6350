This is a machine learning library developed by Sergio Remigio
for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

github url: https://github.com/SergioRemigio/DecisionTree

The python code, homework1 pdf, and another readme are in the car folder.

I only had enough time to implement a DecisionTree for the car
data so there isn't anything important in the bank folder.

How to use DecisionTree parameters:
  1. maximumTreeDepth controls the depth of the DecisionTree by limiting the number of attributes that can be used to split on.
  2. importExamples takes in a .csv file as a paramater to read all of the training examples.

  3. attributes is an array containing all of the possible attributes.

  4.  allAttributesWithValues is a dictionary that associates an attribute with a list of their possible values.
