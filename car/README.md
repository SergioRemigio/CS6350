1. Comments to Evaluators:
  The main in CarEvaluation will produce all of the results
  that were used to generate the graph in the homework.

  You can see the results by running the run.sh file included

  The run.sh file also assumes that the test.csv, training.csv, and
  CarEvaluationID3 are in the same directory as the run.sh file.

  I used python3 to run my program
